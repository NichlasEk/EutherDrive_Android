# Gauntlet DL Progress Plan - 2026-06-30

## 2026-06-30 Execution Update

Implemented the first work slice and used it to isolate the current plateau.

Code changes made in this slice:

- `GauntletProbe` now supports `EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_SUMMARY=1`.
- Each checkpoint emits one stable `summary gauntdl ...` line with module id,
  snapshot path, warmup state, PC, frame hash, visible framebuffer SHA-256,
  framebuffer non-black/colored counts, draw/setup counters, texture-map
  counters, cmdstop, and packet type counts.
- `EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_EXPERIMENT_RUNTIME_BGLOADMODEL_INDEXED_SOURCE_STRIDE`
  default was restored from `0x8000` to `0x2000`. The env override remains
  available for diagnostics.

Bisect result:

```text
good  cfdbf4c6 Accept hex Gauntlet probe integer flags
bad   8fbf62ec Promote Gauntlet indexed source stride
cause default stride changed 0x2000 -> 0x8000
```

Representative cold f180-to-f220 oracle results:

```text

```

```

Conclusion: the worst current `0xd1549bb3` plateau was caused by promoting the
indexed source stride to `0x8000`. Restoring `0x2000` recovers the documented
`0x44d3a578` high-work f420 family. The next work should continue from this
restored f420 baseline, not from the broken `0xd1549bb3` family.

## Initial Verified State Before Execution

Starting checkout: `56b0ead3 Trace Gauntlet texture upload caller transitions`.
The worktree was clean before this plan was written.

The current auto warm snapshot is module-specific and newer than the documented
June 22/23 baseline:

```text
/tmp/eutherdrive-gauntlet-probe/gauntdl-gauntdl24-fast-raw-f180-s200000-e27b9a6b6d3d.warm
```

Fresh f180-to-f420 verification on current HEAD no longer matches the older
`0x44d3a578` or `0x772ab040` documented graphics baselines. It now plateaus
early:

```text
f220 frameHash=0xd1549bb3 direct/setup=301/134 framebuffer=307200/297042
f260 frameHash=0xd1549bb3 direct/setup=301/134 framebuffer=307200/297042
f420 frameHash=0xd1549bb3 direct/setup=301/134 framebuffer=307200/297042
cmdstop=invalid-standard-window/0xBC292A85/337234/.../pc=0xFFFFFFFF800C4E5C
textureMap.writes=0 at f220
```

The dumped f260/f420 image is not real scene graphics. It is a stable colored
band/block output, and f260/f420 PNG signatures match.

`EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_EXPERIMENT_RUNTIME_BGLOADMODEL_FULL_INDEXED_SOURCE_PAYLOADS=0`
does not change this result when starting from the current f180 snapshot. That
means the bad state is either already present by f180, or this flag is not the
active control after f180.

The Type5 stale-packet control is still diagnostic-only. Re-running
`EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_EXPERIMENT_VOODOO_DROP_IMPLAUSIBLE_TYPE5_PACKETS=1` from
the current f180 snapshot got past the first f220 plateau and reached:

```text
f260 frameHash=0xd1549bb3 direct/setup=301/134 -> 301/134 visible hash unchanged
f260 packetTypes default: 0:17,1:15669,2:0,3:12791,4:46035,5:5712,6:1,7:0
f260 packetTypes type5drop: 0:28,1:21735,2:0,3:16819,4:60848,5:10189,6:1,7:2
```

The rerun then failed to reach f420 in a reasonable time and was interrupted.
This is useful evidence: dropping the first absurd Type5 packet is not a fix,
but it proves the current blocker is command-FIFO state/read-window ownership
before the older `state+0x08` texture-source investigation can continue.

## External References Worth Using

Use modern MAME as the primary reference for Midway Vegas machine behavior and
Voodoo command FIFO semantics:

- https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/midway/vegas.cpp
- https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/devices/video/voodoo.cpp
- https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/devices/video/voodoo_2.cpp

Use MAME 2003-Plus only as a secondary readability reference for older Voodoo
raster/texture code. It does not appear to carry the useful Vegas/Gauntlet DL
driver path, but the smaller Voodoo implementation is easier to compare against
when modern MAME is too broad:

- https://github.com/libretro/mame2003-plus-libretro/blob/master/src/vidhrdw/voodoo_vidhrdw.c
- https://github.com/libretro/mame2003-plus-libretro/blob/master/src/vidhrdw/voodblit.c
- https://github.com/libretro/mame2003-plus-libretro/blob/master/src/vidhrdw/voodoo.h

## Revised Priority Order

### 1. Freeze and Compare Repro Baselines - Done

Two comparable runs were preserved before changing the default:

- current HEAD + current f180 snapshot, f220/f260/f420 checkpoints;
- current HEAD + a cold regenerated f180 with the same current flags, then
  f220/f260/f420 checkpoints.

The goal is to separate three possibilities:

- the current f180 snapshot is poisoned;
- the current default preset changed since the older `0x44d3a578` baseline;
- a recent committed fix changed module ID and behavior, and the old snapshot
  cannot be compared directly.

The f420 run was interrupted after f260 during the first pass, but the f220 and
f260 summaries were enough to prove the same `0xd1549bb3` family from current
warm and cold snapshots. The stabilized summary mode now covers the success
criteria:

```text
One table with snapshot path, module id, frame hashes, direct/setup counters,
cmdstop reason, textureMap.writes, and dump hash for f220/f260/f420.
```

### 2. Bisect the Regression Family - Done

The first bad commit for the current `0xd1549bb3` family is:

```text
8fbf62ec Promote Gauntlet indexed source stride
```

The parent `cfdbf4c6` is good in this narrower oracle. The only code change is:

```text
ParsePositiveInt(... INDEXED_SOURCE_STRIDE, 0x2000)
-> ParsePositiveInt(... INDEXED_SOURCE_STRIDE, 0x8000)
```

### 3. Re-establish the Restored Baseline at f420 - Done

The fixed default was run from the saved f180 snapshot through f420:

```text
EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_BRINGUP_BASELINE=1
EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_SUMMARY=1
EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_WARMUP_STATE=/tmp/eutherdrive-gauntlet-probe/head-default-after-stridefix-f180.warm
EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_WARMUP_FRAMES=180
EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_FRAME_CHECKPOINTS=220,260,420
```

Result:

```text
f220 0xe806de53 direct/setup=804/385
f260 0xe806de53 direct/setup=1090/528
f420 0x44d3a578 direct/setup=3288/49236
```

### 4. Resume `state+0x08` Upload-Source Tracing From f420

The June 23 trace now matters again because render/FIFO progress is back in the
older family. The previous texture-source conclusion was:

```text
The upload caller copies zero from Glide state+0x08 into sp+0x1c at 800fe34c.
The descriptor at 80312998/803129a4 is stable.
```

Continue upstream ownership of that Glide state word from the restored f420
baseline. Do not use the broken `0xd1549bb3` / `0xBC292A85` path for this work.

Success criteria:

```text
Focused trace shows who last writes state+0x08 before 800fe34c, and whether that
write matches MAME/Glide expected state for the corresponding upload descriptor.
```

### 5. Instrument Command-FIFO Ownership If f420 Still Stalls Visibly

The restored f420 baseline still ends with:

```text
cmdstop=invalid-standard-window/0x00012609/2/1/0x3e108/...
```

If source-state tracing does not improve visible output, add a narrow trace
around writes that alter command FIFO base/min/max/depth/read pointer, bulk
write start/end indices, packets decoded immediately before the Type2/Type3
cmdstop, and caller PC/trigger path for the write/decode.

Success criteria:

```text
First wrong transition identified as either host-side FIFO register state,
bulk writer bookkeeping, packet-window validation, or snapshot serialization.
```

### 6. Promote Only Visible or Causal Fixes

Keep these diagnostic-only unless they become part of a proven causal repair:

- broad implausible packet drops;
- Type5-only stale packet drop;
- zero-word disk substitution;
- broad BGLoadModel source mutation;
- MAME FIFO model toggles as one-shot preset swaps.

Promotion bar:

```text
The fix must either restore the older high-work f420 family or improve visible
frame dumps without reducing live command/texture activity. Counter-only gains
are not enough.
```

## Next Concrete Work Slice

1. Resume the `state+0x08` ownership trace from the restored f420 baseline.
2. Use `/tmp/eutherdrive-gauntlet-probe/head-default-after-stridefix-f180.warm`
   as the warm start and keep `EUTHERDRIVE_GAUNTDL_SUMMARY=1` on every probe.
3. Keep `0xd1549bb3`, `0xBC292A85`, and `direct/setup=301/134` as a regression
   guard for any future BGLoadModel stride/source experiment.
4. If `state+0x08` tracing does not explain the blank/incorrect visible state,
   instrument the restored f420 Type2/Type3 cmdstop window around `0x00012609`.
5. Promote no additional BGLoadModel/Voodoo experiments unless they improve
   visible frames or restore the older high-work f420 counters.
